  "explanation": "Prophet Ibrahim and prophet Isma-il, while building the holy Ka’-bah, prayed to Allah for the successful completion of their project. Putting in their best efforts does not make your labor fruitful, because there are many unknown and uncontrollable forces working in the universe that can bring disappointment if Allah, who not only knows but has total control over all things and events, does not help you. So always invoke Allah by reciting this verse in the traditions of His prophets whenever you take up a job, which has not been prohibited.\n\nAlso, recite this verse at the end of any good deed—after praying any wajib or sunnah salat, or when you have read the whole or part of the Holy Qur’an in a single sitting, or after attending a majlis (a religious gathering for mentioning the merits of the Holy Prophet and his Ahl ul Bayt).\n\nRecitation of this verse is also recommended for seeking fulfillment of any legitimate desires.",

So beseech Him for the good in both the worlds.\n\nThis verse is generally recited as qunoot in all prayers. It can be recited at the time of walking around (tawaf) the Holy Ka’-bah.",

Musa noticed that on account of fasting his mouth was stinking, so he thought it improper to pronounce the glory of Allah with a stinking mouth and brushed his teeth. It was considered an act of disobedience and he was required to observe fast for ten more days.\n\nAfter 40 days, Musa came back to his people with the Tawrat, but he found his people worshipping the false god of the magician Saamiree. Seeing this, Musa became angry and criticised his brother Haroon who was acting as his lieutenant, in his 40 days absence. Haroon explained that he tried his best to keep them on the right path and warned them against the tricks of the magician but they paid no attention to his advice, so his brother (Musa) should have not included him in the group of his unjust followers. Musa on hearing the explanation of Haroon recited this dua’a.\n\nIt is highly recommended to read this dua’a as qunoot in all prayers.",

When they turned away, Allah asked the Holy Prophet to recite this verse.\n\nThis dua’a was recited by the Holy Prophet. We, his followers, must also recite it to put our trust in Allah (alone) and to ask for the fulfillment of all our desires. If recited 66 times daily, it brings honour and respect.",

The sunnah (way of life) of the infallible Prophets is a guidance for us.\n\nIt is obligatory to love our parents and respect them because through them we are brought into this world. Allah, who provides sustenance to all, has selected parents to give livelihood to all that which have been created by Him. So next to the almighty Allah we owe everything in our life to our parents. They take care of us from the day we are born. They bring us up with love and care.\n\nIt is a well known fact that Allah, in His infinite mercy, has created love of mother, to keep alive the circle of continuous life on this earth, and because of this it is said that paradise lies under the feet of the mother.\n\nLove of parents for their children is the divine wisdom through which mankind and other living beings have been surviving for millions of years on this planet. In no way we can repay our parents for what they do for us, except by following the command of Allah who ask us, in the holy Qur’an, to lower unto them our wings of submission through compassion and recite this dua’a.",
